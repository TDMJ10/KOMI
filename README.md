# ABOUT
Komi is an autonomous robot that has basic object recognition abilities for general humans. Komi uses Computer Vision Through An ESP32 AI Thinker OV2640 Camera running Edge Impulse's YOLO Model. Komi possesses the ability to act on its own to greet humans it sees, waving to the closest person it sees and  roam around on its own. Komi is planned to have a remote control and video feed.

Komi is not that advanced (very very basic honestly with lots of roundabout methods to do things) don't expect too much from it. Theres DEFINITELY better ways to do this project, I am just working through what i do know as of the time of working on this.



# PROJECT UPDATES
Revising Design. Circuitry Updated (Revision 3).

# PROJECT TO DO
1: Create MASTER Code (45%) - MASTER Changed

2: Prepare Edge Impulse Camera

>3: Create Access Point and Camera Website

4: Create Head Assembly

>5: Create Arms Assembly

>6: Create Remote

>7: Testing

# PROJECT AIMS
>> Make Komi able to recognise humans and look at them directly.

>> Make Komi able to recognise a waving hand and wave back.

>> Have Komi be able to act on its own while also having a controller that can immediately (or as close as possible) override Komi's current actions

>> Have Komi be able to feed any device that connects to it its secondary camera information (not object detection camera) (too advanced for ESP32 and outside of my skillset for now)

> Add a speaker system to Komi so that its controller can speak through Komi
