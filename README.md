# PROJECT KOMI
Made for the BRAC University Health & Safety Club

Made by Naim Iftekhar Rahman
Student of BRAC University (24201190), Computer Science & Engineering Department.

Komi is an autonomous robot that has basic object recognition abilities.

# PROJECT STATUS:
Implementing Base level Code For Device Operations And Communication

# PROJECT TO DO:
1: Create MASTER Code
2: Create SLAVE Code
3: Complete Wiring Prototype
4: Create Head Assembly
5: Create Arms Assembly
6: Create Body
7: Testing

# PROJECT AIMS:
>> Make Komi able to recognise humans and look at them directly.
>> Make Komi able to recognise a waving hand and wave back.
>> Have Komi be able to act on its own while also having a controller that can immediately (or as close as possible) override Komi's current actions

> Have Komi be able to detect fires on its own through a thermistor, flame or gas sensor. 
> Add additional attachments to aid safety demonstrations
  > Will likely just be mock water pumps (nothing that can actually put out a fire sadly).
